    <td>It has been a re-occuring trend recently with the way that i stay focused in class and this continued in this lesson as i truly believe that it works. This method allowed me to make sure that i concentrated at all times. Although this was useful when making changes to our number guesser it was most useful when we were at the front learning about how to apply functions into our work ( def main(): ), the reason that this was very useful is because we were learning something new so it would badly damage your work later on down the line if you were to not pay attention at the time.   </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Like in my focusing tactic a habit that i need to work on seems to appear every lesson, this is putting my hand up in class. This was not as much of a problem as in later weeks as i did ask a few questions but there were times where i feel like i should have asked a question and i didn't  (luckily i was bailed out by somebody else who happened to ask the same question).   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Confidence about asking questions is still a big problem for me and i although i did make improvements this lesson i will make sure to keep improving in the next. As i have learned the person preventing my learning isn't anyone else around me but it is in fact myself.
