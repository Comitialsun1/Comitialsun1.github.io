    <td>After our first lesson working on our questionnaires sir saw how most of us were coding without using any functions at all. This meant that we were typing in much more code than we needed to, slowing down the code and creating more programming for ourselves. Because of this sir brought us to the front of the class to give us a demonstration on how to use functions in python. When i got the front of the class i made sure to pay close attention as we will as i knew that it would play a big part in the final outcome of the coding. In the end i did have a code with functions applied however it did not work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Although i did manage to memorise the code i fell into a large problem that i had encountered many weeks before. This problem was that i didn't plan my actual code, last week we had done a week of straight planning  compared to zero this week. Although i was using the same questions i would be constantly trying new things in my code until i had created so many problems that i had to start again from scratch!</td>

    <td>Next lesson i will make sure to plan ahead if i am likely to make any drastic changes to my code or at least think very methodically.
