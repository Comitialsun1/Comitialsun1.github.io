    <td>The way that I learned was to keep my concentration up, the way that I did this was to not allow my eyes or mind to wander from the task allowing me to take everything in. This helped me when we got to our first task I was able to get through it at a quick pace. Despite my tactics the next exercise proved fairly difficult and the way I got through it was by applying my knowledge and a bit of trial and error. This method worked but it took longer than I would have preferred.</td>

    <td>Not much limited my learning however when using my method of trial and error I should have gone for a more logical approach rather than try and get through it as quickly as I could.</td>

    <td>Next lesson I will take a step back from the task and think about it before I start it, rather than  diving straight in and becoming stuck and creating bigger problems for myself.</td>
