  <tr>
    <td>The way that i learnt was to take a lot more in depth notes about what we were doing. This helped me as it meant that i would not get lost in the homework and not understand what to do. Another reason that this helped me a lot was as i knew that if i was struggling to remember one part than i could always go back to my notes. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For my github pages i needed to make sure that i used not just all of the resources provided to help me but to read through them in great detail. This does not just help with my github page but it works with any piece of work. I also need to make sure i read through even the little parts thoroughly as it will cause more damage down the line. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will make sure to take down all notes from the lesson as it can be very hindering if i don't. I need to also make sure that i make the most of any resources or i can just try and find it myself. I need to make sure that i understand everything the teacher is saying as it may seem an easy option however it will make work a lot harder down the road.</td>
