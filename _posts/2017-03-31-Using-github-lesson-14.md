  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson listening was key as we were having to take in lots of new vocabulary, the way in which I look at it is the learning Python is like learning a foreign language, you have to apply your past knowledge and use common sense to understand what the code will do. Therefore I always try to pay especially close attention in lessons like this as there is it will be very hard down the line to complete work using this code if I do not understand the basics of it.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I do not think much limited my learning however for the first time in a few weeks I decided to take notes down on my iPad. The notes unfortunately weren't as good as I would have liked and looking back on it now it would most likely have been more useful to be able to concentrate one hundred percent on the board and what sir is saying rather than focusing on getting notes down.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I won't take notes on my iPad, I believe this will improve my learning a lot more as I only have one thing to focus on rather than splitting my focus between two things.
