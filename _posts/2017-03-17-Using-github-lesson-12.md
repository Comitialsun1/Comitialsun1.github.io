    <td>I decided this lesson to do the same thing that i have been doing for a few weeks now, this consist of me keeping my eyes focused on the task and therefore not letting me be distracted.
When concentrating i have learnt that your ears tend to follow your eyes (unless you deliberately try to listen to something else going on in the classroom!), what i mean by this id that if you focus your eyes on something then your ears will try to listen to what you're focused on. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was basically me being too shy. This results in me not putting my hand up when i don't fully understand something however my brain just won't let me do it. I'm not sure why it happens as i have known everyone in my class for a minimum of two years and the others i have known for 3. Although my focusing tactic i did remember one part of last lesson where i did not understand however my brain wouldn't let me put my hand up!, more than anything this shyness is flat out annoying, because it means that i have to research what i didn't understand in the lesson for homework which just wastes my time.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What i need to improve for next lesson is my confidence as this will not only help me in IT, and in School but also in the real world. If i can get rid of this lack of confidence in myself it will help me in everything i do drastically. Even my running (my best sport) will be improved as i have confidence in myself i can run how i feel and not worry about what other people are doing in the race. If i still have this lack of confidence and shyness will affect what job i get as i will not be good at talking to someone that i have just met! The way that i will improve is by automatically putting my hand up when i don't understand as it gives my brain less time to stop me from doing so (within reason obviously). I will also try to forget everyone else in a way because if i was in a one on one with sir, i'm sure i wouldn't be anywhere near as shy .   </td>
