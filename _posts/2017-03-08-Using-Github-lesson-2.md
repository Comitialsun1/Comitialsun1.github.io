    <td>Once again I used my ipad to take notes because this allowed me to go back on the key points that i had taken down and therefore improve my website in ways which i may have forgotten later on in the lesson.  </td>

    <td>The only thing that limited me was the time spent at the computer as i was not efficient enough with my work. I reckon that worked about three quarters of my best meaning i had lots more to do for homework.</td>

    <td>Next lesson i will make sure that any time i have at my computer i will use to my advantage by just getting my head down and doing as much work as possible.</td>
