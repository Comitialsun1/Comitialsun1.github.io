    <td>What helped my learning in this lesson was that i made sure to stay engaged at all times to make sure that i did not miss any important information. Furthermore i made sure to take notes whenever possible just to make sure that even if i ended up forgetting something then i can always go back to my notes.  </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to make sure that i log into all of my accounts before sir tells us to move to the board as this only slows me down when we are told to go back to our places.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time i will make sure that i log into my account as soon as possible to allow myself to have less hassle down line when we are told to go back to our seats. Sir also talked to us about positive and negative habits in learning and it has made me think about: how i have a chance to do whatever i want however if i just don't listen then even though it will seem better at the time it will catch up to us in the end, making our lives a lot more miserable and unfulfilling. Therefore what i will change for next time is to make sure that i cannot get distracted and use break and lunch for talking and socialising.      </td>
