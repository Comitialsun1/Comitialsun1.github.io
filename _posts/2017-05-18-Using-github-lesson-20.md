    <td>Although i did not work as well as i had the week before i still managed to work well as we had the entire lesson to work due to it being a cover lesson (no new information to take in).
In fact the lesson actually went so well that i managed to finish my questionnaire. </td>

    <td>Even though i did finish my questionnaire there were a few problems with it, for instance the code was very similar to other peoples, another problem with it was that there were no functions included meaning that there was lots of extra lines.  </td>

    <td>Next lesson i will work on a new code (with the same questions) built with functions as it ends up making the coding, and future coding a lot easier.
