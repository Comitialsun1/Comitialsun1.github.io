    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Because there was a large amount new information to take in ,the key was to pay attention.
It also helped that after we learned something new we were able to put it to practise with questions that sir could set.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Because of the large amount of new information caused my brain to slow down, it would take me a bit longer every time. It ended up being a kind of chain reaction, the extra time it took me to work out one meant that that was added on to the next problem. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will make sure to be more efficient with my workings as to be able to accomplish more in the 1 hour and the extra work for homework.</td>
