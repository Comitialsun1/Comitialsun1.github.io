    <td>The way i learned was by making sure to listen to listen to everything that sir was saying about what we need to do for either our actual page or about how to make our blogs a lot more interesting to keep the reader engaged. I payed particularly good attention to what sir was saying about making our blogs look better for instance putting table rules into our blogs to give it a clear order, or even about putting a transparent background into my page for as it is visually pleasing.     </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What i needed to work on was to not worry about what other people think grades wise as i was sometimes cautious to put my hand up to vote for grades however apart from this i dont think i did to badly. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning i will try and not follow the crowd as this limits my learning due to me not having to think about why i am giving someone a certain grad and it lets me kind of coast along without doing any actual thinking.</td>
